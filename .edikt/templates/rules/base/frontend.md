<governance_checkpoint>
Before modifying any file, pause and verify:
1. List which rules from this file apply to the change you are about to make.
2. Check if the change breaks component boundaries, accessibility, or state management patterns.
3. If multiple rules conflict, state the conflict before proceeding.
After receiving tool results (test output, lint output, build errors), re-check:
1. Verify the result complies with the rules you identified above.
2. If it does not, fix the violation before taking any other action.
3. Do not chain corrections — verify each step against these rules before proceeding.

# Frontend

Rules for building accessible, performant, maintainable user interfaces.

## Critical

- MUST handle all async states: loading (skeleton, not blank screen), error (message + retry), empty (helpful prompt, not blank space), and success. A blank screen for any state is a bug.
- MUST make every interactive element keyboard accessible: Tab, Enter, Escape, Arrow keys. If you can't complete the flow without a mouse, it's broken.
- NEVER use color as the only means of conveying information. Add text, icons, or patterns.

## Standards

- Components do ONE thing. If a component fetches data AND renders AND handles interactions, split it. Separate data-fetching (container) from presentation (pure) components.
- Local state first. Only lift state up when siblings need it. URL state for things users should bookmark (filters, pagination). Global state only for truly app-wide concerns (auth, theme, feature flags). Server state (React Query, SWR) for API data — not global store.
- Form inputs need associated `<label>` elements. Placeholders are not labels.
- Use semantic HTML (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<button>`) over `<div>` with roles. Prefer native elements before reaching for ARIA.
- Use design tokens or CSS variables for colors, spacing, and typography. Never hardcode values.

## Practices

- Lazy load routes and heavy components. Don't load the settings page when the user is on the homepage.
- Images: use appropriate formats (WebP/AVIF), include width/height to prevent layout shift, lazy load below-the-fold.
- Memoize expensive computations only when profiling shows a bottleneck — don't premature-optimize.
- Check bundle imports: `import { debounce } from 'lodash'` pulls the entire library. Use `import debounce from 'lodash/debounce'` or a smaller alternative.
- Disable submit while a request is in flight. Show a loading state.

## Critical

- MUST handle all async states — no blank screens.
- MUST ensure keyboard accessibility for all interactive elements.
