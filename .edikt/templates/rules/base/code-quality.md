<governance_checkpoint>
Before modifying any file, pause and verify:
1. List which rules from this file apply to the change you are about to make.
2. Check if the change introduces naming violations, excessive complexity, or premature abstraction.
3. If multiple rules conflict, state the conflict before proceeding.
After receiving tool results (test output, lint output, build errors), re-check:
1. Verify the result complies with the rules you identified above.
2. If it does not, fix the violation before taking any other action.
3. Do not chain corrections — verify each step against these rules before proceeding.

# Code Quality

Rules for writing clean, maintainable, production-grade code.

## Critical

- NEVER use generic names: `utils`, `helpers`, `common`, `shared`, `misc`. A `utils.go` with 10 unrelated functions is a design failure — each function belongs in the module it serves.
- NEVER commit TODO/FIXME/HACK comments without a linked issue number.
- MUST keep functions under 50 lines. If a function grows beyond that, extract helpers — not because of the line count, but because the function is doing too much.

## Standards

- Prefer early returns over nested conditions. Max nesting depth: 3 levels. If you need 4 levels, flatten with guards.
- No circular dependencies between packages or modules.
- A package must not import from a sibling's internal details — only from its public interface.
- Business logic must not live in HTTP handlers, UI components, or database layers.
- HTTP concerns (status codes, headers, serialization) must not leak into business logic.
- NEVER call a function, method, or API without verifying it exists in the version of the dependency the project uses. If you cannot verify a function exists, state that explicitly rather than guessing the signature.
- NEVER submit placeholder implementations — `// TODO`, `pass`, `throw new Error("not implemented")`, or functions that return hardcoded values. Every function must contain real logic. If you cannot implement it, say so.
- MUST match the conventions of the existing codebase. Before creating a new function or type, read existing examples in the same project to understand error handling patterns, naming, parameter ordering, and file organization. Consistency with the codebase overrides language defaults.
- NEVER introduce an abstraction (interface, factory, registry, plugin system) unless there are at least two concrete implementations needed today — "we might need this later" is not a justification.
- NEVER share mutable state between concurrent execution paths (goroutines, threads, async tasks, Promise.all) without explicit synchronization — mutex, channel, or immutable data.
- MUST handle edge case inputs: empty collections (return early or handle explicitly), nil/null pointers (guard before dereferencing), zero values (check before division), boundary values (max int, empty string). The happy path is not the only path.

## Practices

- Add comments for: why a non-obvious approach was chosen, business rules not evident from code, and workarounds with links to issues. Not for restating what the code does.

## Critical

- NEVER use generic names: `utils`, `helpers`, `common`, `shared`, `misc`.
- MUST keep functions under 50 lines.
