<governance_checkpoint>
Before modifying any file, pause and verify:
1. List which rules from this file apply to the change you are about to make.
2. Check if the change bypasses the service container, skips form validation, or misuses event listeners.
3. If multiple rules conflict, state the conflict before proceeding.
After receiving tool results (test output, lint output, build errors), re-check:
1. Verify the result complies with the rules you identified above.
2. If it does not, fix the violation before taking any other action.
3. Do not chain corrections — verify each step against these rules before proceeding.

# Symfony

Rules for building Symfony applications.

## Critical

- NEVER call `$container->get()` inside a service or controller — that is service location, not dependency injection. It defeats the container's ability to manage dependencies and makes testing impossible without a full container.
- NEVER check roles directly in business logic. Authorization belongs in voters (`#[IsGranted]` or `$this->denyAccessUnlessGranted()`), not in if/else conditionals inside services.
- MUST use constructor injection exclusively. Services are autowired by default — let the container wire them.

## Standards

- Type-hint interfaces in constructors when multiple implementations exist. When there is only one implementation, concrete type-hinting is acceptable — don't introduce an interface for one class.
- Define entities with PHP attributes, not XML or YAML mappings. Attributes keep mapping co-located with the entity definition.
- Use custom repositories that extend `ServiceEntityRepository`. All query logic lives in repositories — never in controllers or services.
- Use Doctrine QueryBuilder or DQL for complex queries. Define indexes on columns used in WHERE and ORDER BY clauses.
- Use `php bin/console make:migration` for ALL schema changes. Never alter the database manually or modify existing migrations that have been deployed.
- Use Symfony Messenger for async operations (emails, notifications, external API calls). Messages are simple DTOs. Handlers contain the logic. Use `#[AsMessageHandler]`.

## Practices

- Return typed responses: `JsonResponse`, `Response`, `RedirectResponse`. Don't return raw strings.
- Use `#[MapRequestPayload]` or Form types for request deserialization and validation. Don't manually read from `$request->getContent()` and decode.
- Use `WebTestCase` for controller tests (HTTP layer). Use `KernelTestCase` for service integration tests. Reset the database between tests with `dama/doctrine-test-bundle`.

## Critical

- NEVER use service location (`$container->get()`) inside services.
- NEVER check authorization in business logic — use voters.
