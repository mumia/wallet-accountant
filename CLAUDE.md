## edikt

### Project

**wallet-accountant** — multi-tenant personal accounts management. Kotlin (Gradle) + Spring + Axon Framework 5 + Restate (durable execution). Axon Server for events, MongoDB for read models. Hexagonal/DDD with strict layer separation (domain → application → adapter; adapters split into `in/web`, `in/restate`, `out/readmodel`).

### Before Writing Code

1. Read `docs/project-context.md` for project context
2. Rules are enforced automatically via `.claude/rules/`
3. If a plan is active, read it in `docs/plans/` — check progress table for current state
4. If a spec exists, read it in `docs/product/specs/` — the spec and its artifacts are the engineering blueprint
5. All paths are configurable in `.edikt/config.yaml` under `paths:`

### Output Conventions

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ | Action completed successfully |
| 🔴 | Critical finding — must fix before shipping |
| 🟡 | Warning — should fix, not blocking |
| 🟢 | Healthy / no issues |
| ⚠ | Needs attention |
| 🔀 | Routing to specialist agent |

### After Compaction

If context was compacted, the PostCompact hook will re-inject the active plan phase and invariants automatically. If you need full context, run `/edikt:context`.

### Commit Convention

No enforced commit convention — write descriptive subject lines and explain the *why* in the body. (Set in `.edikt/config.yaml` → `sdlc.commit-convention: none`. Switch to conventional commits later via `/edikt:config` if desired.)
