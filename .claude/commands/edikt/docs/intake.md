# edikt:docs:intake

Scan the project for existing documentation and organize it into edikt's standard structure.

CRITICAL: This command requires interactive input. If you are in plan mode (you can only describe actions, not perform them), output this and stop:
```
⚠️  This command requires user interaction and cannot run in plan mode.
Exit plan mode first, then run the command again.
```

## Instructions

### 1. Verify edikt is Initialized

Check for `.edikt/config.yaml`. If not found:
```
No edikt config found. Run /edikt:init to set up this project.
```

Read config to get `base:` directory.

### 2. Scan for Existing Docs

Use an Agent to find documentation scattered across the project:

```
Agent(
  subagent_type: "Explore",
  prompt: """
  Find all documentation in this project. Look for:
  1. README files (README.md, readme.md at any level)
  2. docs/ or documentation/ directories
  3. Wiki content or markdown files outside src/
  4. Architecture docs (ADRs, decisions, RFCs)
  5. API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger specs, API.md)
  6. Existing business rules or invariants docs
  7. Onboarding guides, contributing guides
  8. Product specs, PRDs, requirements docs
  9. Runbooks, playbooks, deployment docs
  For each file found, report:
  - Path
  - Type (architecture, product, reference, onboarding, api, etc.)
  - Brief summary of content (first 2-3 lines)

  Do NOT include: source code files, test files, generated docs, node_modules, vendor.
  """,
  description: "Scan for existing docs"
)
```

### 3. Categorize and Propose

Organize found docs into edikt categories:

```
Found {n} documentation files:

  Architecture / Decisions:
    docs/adr/001-use-postgres.md     → {base}/decisions/001-use-postgres.md

  Product / Requirements:
    docs/product-spec.md             → {base}/product/spec.md
    docs/requirements/feature-x.md   → {base}/product/prds/feature-x.md

  Reference:
    docs/api.md                      → {base}/reference/api.md
    docs/deployment.md               → {base}/reference/deployment.md
    CONTRIBUTING.md                   → {base}/reference/contributing.md

  Already in place:
    README.md                        → (keep as-is)

  Skip (not documentation):
    {list any files to skip}

Proceed with this organization? (y/n/edit)
```

### 4. Consolidate Execution Plans

After categorization, check if any files look like execution plans — files containing phases, milestones, roadmaps, checklists, progress tracking, build order, or prioritization.

If plan-related files are found:

```
EXECUTION PLANS DETECTED
────────────────────────
Found {n} plan-related docs:
  - build-order.md (build sequence with phases)
  - progress.md (status tracking)
  - refactor-checklist.md (task list with milestones)

These could consolidate into a single PLAN-001-{slug}.md with a phases table.

Options:
  [1] Consolidate into PLAN-001-{slug}.md (preserves all content as phases)
  [2] Keep separate — copy as-is to {base}/plans/
  [3] Skip — don't move plan files
```

**If consolidating:**
1. Read all plan-related files to extract phases, tasks, and milestones
2. Generate a `PLAN-001-{slug}.md` following edikt's plan format:
   ```markdown
   # Plan: {Title derived from content}

   ## Overview
   **Total Phases:** {n}
   **Approach:** {derived from source docs}

   ## Progress

   | Phase | Status | Updated |
   |-------|--------|---------|
   | 1     | -      | -       |

   ## Phase 1: {Title}

   **Objective:** {extracted from source docs}

   **Tasks:**
   {consolidated task list}

   **Completion promise:** `{PHASE TITLE DONE}`
   ```
3. Save to `{base}/plans/PLAN-001-{slug}.md`
4. Track original plan files for the archive step

**If keeping separate:** copy files as-is to `{base}/plans/`.

### 5. Execute Moves

For each confirmed move:

1. Create target directory if needed: `mkdir -p {base}/{category}/`
2. Copy (not move) the file to its new location: `cp source target`
3. Note the original source path so the user can clean up after verifying

**Important:** COPY, don't move. The user can delete originals after verifying. Never delete files without explicit confirmation.

### 6. Update Project Context

If existing docs reveal project context not captured in `project-context.md`, offer to update it:

```
Found additional context from existing docs:
- Stack: {details from README}
- Architecture: {details from ADRs}
- Users: {details from product docs}

Update project-context.md with this information? (y/n)
```

### 7. Output Summary

```
✅ Intake complete: {n} documents organized

  Organized: {n} files
  Copied to:
    {base}/decisions/     — {count} decision records
    {base}/invariants/    — {count} invariants
    {base}/plans/         — {count} plans {(consolidated) if applicable}
    {base}/product/prds/  — {count} product requirements
    {base}/reference/     — {count} reference docs

  Project context updated: {yes/no}
```

### 9. Archive Originals

After displaying the summary, offer cleanup for all copied files:

```
CLEANUP
───────
{n} original files were copied to new locations.

Options:
  [1] Archive originals to {base}/archive/ (removes from active, preserves history)
  [2] Delete originals (destructive — will confirm each file)
  [3] Keep both (default — safe, creates duplication)
```

**If archiving:**
1. `mkdir -p {base}/archive/`
2. Move each original to `{base}/archive/`, preserving relative paths

**If deleting:**
1. List each file and ask for confirmation: `Delete {path}? (y/n)`
2. Only delete files the user confirms

**If keeping:** no action needed.

After cleanup:

```
  Next: Review the organized docs and run /edikt:context to load everything.
```
